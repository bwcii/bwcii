### Hello everyone!

I'm Benjamin Crouch II (He/Him) and my purpose in life is to save humanity as many labor-hours as possible.

I've spent several years working all around different parts of the enterprise tech stack, and have finally found myself on the software engineering half of the building. 
I'm at the point where I want to start putting the different pieces of what I've learned into one spot, mostly so I don't have to check a million places to find my notes and code, but also because I know there are people out there that'll benefit from having my failures and solutions out there on display.

I'm interested in Machine Learning, *nix systems programming, enterprise networking, information security, automation, DevOps, SRE, blah, blah, blah... The details aren't important. The only important thing worth mentioning is that I'm interested in learning new technologies, solutions, and interesting problems. 
I'm so thankful to have a career that lets me do that.

You can find me on ùïè (twitter) @bwcii_tech. 

Don't be a stranger! I may not have the answer you're looking for, but I can be your digital rubber duck if nothing else.
